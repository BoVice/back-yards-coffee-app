          <p class="fontwwa" style="text-align:justify">Our story began with making cold brew coffee and selling it at craft fairs. Before long, Mayra was taking orders for up to 40 gallons a week. After obtaining some coffee beans directly from Mexico, we found a Michigan
            roaster that would let us roast once a week, and we began selling bags of beans to subscribers.
          </p>
          <p class="fontwwa" style="text-align:justify">Thanks in part to community support, we were able to raise enough money to start our own roastery. Since the coffeehouse at 2059 W 47th Street opened in early 2017, business has been booming. As a testament to our great
            tasting coffee, Zagat recently rated us as one of the
            <a href="https://www.zagat.com/b/10-hottest-coffee-shops-in-chicago">ten hottest coffee shops
            </a>in Chicago!

          <p class="fontwwa">Our coffee is selected from the finest beans available from around the world and sourced in a socially and environmentally responsible way.</p>
          <p class="fontwwa">We've established direct relationships with coffee growers in Chiapas, Mexico. This provides additional revenue while allowing us to offer high quality specialty coffee in our neighborhood at a reasonable price.</p>

          <p class="fontwwa" style="text-align:justify">We hope to change the narrative of a neighborhood negatively associated with gang violence. We have developed a social impact fund which donates $1 of every bag of coffee sold toward scholarships and funding for young
            people in Back of the Yards. The social impact fund is meant to fund youth programs, education and scholarships as well as encouraging peace within the community.</p>
          <p class="fontwwa" style="text-align:justify">We are also committed to sustainability and strive to reduce the wastes generated by our store by offering reusable cups and by composting other wastes. We sell baked goods in our coffeehouse made from locally-grown
            ingredients and seek to source as many products from the neighborhood as possible from around the neighborhood.</p>
